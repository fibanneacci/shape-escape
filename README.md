# Shape Escape
### Graph traversal maze game

Xcode Playground for learning BFS/DFS through maze game.

Includes tutorial pages for both algorithms, with extra mazes at the end for practice.

I recently uploaded the code & asset files for a code sample. To use, you can create an Xcode Playground (for macOS) and copy the files into your playground folders, or just download the zip file.
